			Journalism workshop 2019 dress code
			·         Think business casual  — not campus casual. Clothes that are too tight, too skimpy or too revealing are not appropriate.
			·         Reporters and photojournalists should not wear shorts or T-shirts while on duty or during extended periods of time in the newsroom.
			·         Jeans can be worn as long as they do not have holes.
			·         Flip flops and casual sandals should not be worn while on duty.
			·         T-shirts, caps and other articles of clothing with emblems, advertisements and Greek insignia are inappropriate for everyone.
			·         Exposed bellies and shoulders are inappropriate.
			·         Jewelry should be tasteful and unobtrusive.
			·         Students will be conducting interviews and, in some cases, doing on-camera work. While dress clothes aren’t necessary, collared shirts and more business-like attire would be suitable.
