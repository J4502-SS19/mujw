	<p> Diversity has been an historical component of this workshop since it was first offered 48 years ago. The goal is to help a diverse group of students learn how to cover issues, news and current events in an inclusive way. Over seven days, they will produce stories in the School’s award-winning, hands-on learning laboratories, including the Columbia Missourian newspaper; KOMU-TV, the local NBC affiliate; KBIA-FM, mid-Missouri’s NPR affiliate, as well as across multiple media platforms. Instruction will be guided by faculty experts at the Missouri School of Journalism and industry professionals. </p>

<p> The next MUJW will take place in July 23-28, 2019. The workshop is open to exceptional sophomores but junior/senior status is preferred. </p>
