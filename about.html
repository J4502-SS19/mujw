			<p><b> What is the dress code?  </b></p>

			·         Reporters and photojournalists should not wear shorts or T-shirts while on duty or during extended periods of time in the newsroom.
			·         Jeans can be worn as long as they do not have holes.

			·         Exposed bellies and shoulders are inappropriate.
			·         Jewelry should be tasteful and unobtrusive.
			·         Students will be conducting interviews and, in some cases, doing on-camera work. While dress clothes aren’t necessary, collared shirts and more business-like attire would be suitable.</p>

			<p> Casual school clothes are appropriate for the workshop classes. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes, as you will be walking quite a bit every day. However, for students in the MUJW, when you are working in the Columbia Missourian newsroom, you must adhere to its professional dress code below:

If newsroom personnel do not like what you are wearing they will send you to the dorm to change. Continual
violation of the dress code could result in our sending you home from the workshop.

<p><b> What are the rules? </b> </p>

<p> This is our 49th workshop for MUJW, the second for MUJW and the first for MAPRW and we've found that treating the students as professional journalists and strategic communicators works best. This requires that students conduct themselves in a professional manner as well. Because these are serious workshops, we are quite strict when enforcing our rules to ensure that students to get the most out of it. We also want students to be safe at all times. Please be aware of the following expectations for every participant:

1. Plagiarism or unethical work practices will not be tolerated.
2. Students will be on time for instruction.
3. Students will be respectful to editors, to staff, and to each other.
4. Students will follow all rules in laboratories and classrooms and when working with equipment.
5. Students will meet all deadlines.
6. Students will wear their name tags at ALL times.
7. Students will follow the workshop dress code (see below). This is mandatory and you will be sent home for violations.
8. Students will use cell phones for business only and to check in with parents. Dorm counselors will not allow late night cell phone talk sessions or cell phones will be confiscated. These same rules apply to personal computers or tablets.
9. Students will adhere to the residence hall curfew.
10. Male students are not allowed in female living areas and vice versa. Men and women may visit each other in the dorm lobby. Students who violate this rule will be dismissed immediately from the workshop.
