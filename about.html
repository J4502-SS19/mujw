	    <h1>About the Workshop</h1>

			<p> At the Missouri Urban Journalism Workshop, high school students from around the U.S.  work together with the guidance of professional journalists to produce stories, photos and broadcasts.

Read some of the workshoppers’ favorite quotes from sources, experiences and moments using the hashtag #MUJWTwitter.

Diversity has been an historical component of this workshop since it was first offered 48 years ago. The goal is to help a diverse group of students learn how to cover issues, news and current events in an inclusive way. Over seven days, they will produce stories in the School’s award-winning, hands-on learning laboratories, including the Columbia Missourian newspaper; KOMU-TV, the local NBC affiliate; KBIA-FM, mid-Missouri’s NPR affiliate, as well as across multiple media platforms. Instruction will be guided by faculty experts at the Missouri School of Journalism and industry professionals.

The next MUJW will take place in July 2019. The workshop is open to exceptional sophomores but junior/senior status is preferred. For information and an application, contact:
